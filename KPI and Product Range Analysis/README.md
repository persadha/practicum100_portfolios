# Evaluating Sales KPI and Product Range Analysis
The final project of the Practicum100 Germany Data Analyst Bootcamp. 

The project's main task was to do a KPI and project range analysis to see how sales are performing in a year. In this project, I used different techniques to clean and visualize the dataset. As a part of the task, we were asked to put the product items into larger groups. I used the Topic Modelling techniques to find the most common product categories using the item's description as an input. The final number of categories was chosen by evaluating the coherence value of a given range of the possible number of topics. I also did hypothesis testing to check the statistical significance between two groups in the dataset. Finally, recommendations were presented in the last section of the notebook.
