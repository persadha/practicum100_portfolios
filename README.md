# Practicum100 Data Analysis Bootcamp Portfolios

## Evaluating Sales KPI and Product Range Analysis
The final project of the Practicum100 Germany Data Analyst Bootcamp.

The project's main task was to do a KPI and project range 
analysis to see how sales are performing in a year. 
In this project, I used different techniques to clean and 
visualize the dataset. As a part of the task, we were 
asked to put the product items into larger groups. 

I used the Topic Modelling techniques to find the most 
common product categories using the item's description 
as an input. The final number of categories was chosen 
by evaluating the coherence value of a given range of the 
possible number of topics. 

I also did hypothesis testing 
to check the statistical significance between two groups 
in the dataset. Finally, recommendations were presented 
in the last section of the notebook.

## Video Game Analysis
_Keywords: SDA, EDA, hypothesis testing_

This project works on video games sales data that contains the number of sales of games from 31 different gaming platforms (PlayStation 2, 
Nintendo DS, XBox 360, PC console, etc.) in North America, Europe, Japan, and other regions.
We wanted to find out interesting business-related questions such as the best-selling games of all time, which platform is leading sales, and the most profitable genre in each region. We also wanted to find out how different users critics in different genres and platforms with hypotheses test.
