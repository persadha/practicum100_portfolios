# Practicum100 Data Analysis Bootcamp Portfolios

## Evaluating Sales KPI and Product Range Analysis
_Keywords: KPI analysis, Topic Modelling, coherence value, hypothesis testing, recommender system._
The final project of the Practicum100 Germany Data Analyst Bootcamp.

The main task was to do a key performance indicator (KPI) and project range analysis of annual sales. In this project, we used different techniques to were used to clean and visualize the dataset. As part of the task, we attempted to categorize the items into larger groups and identify those commonly sold individually and those in bundles. 

We used the Topic Modelling techniques to find the most common product categories using the item's description as an input. We chose the final number of categories by evaluating the coherence value of a
given range of the possible number of topics. 

Later on, we conducted hypothesis testing to check whether the items commonly sold in bundles generate more revenue than those sold individually. Finally, We presented recommendations based on our findings in the last section of the notebook.

## Business Analysis
_Keywords: retention rate, conversion rate, LTV, CAC, ROMI_

The Business Analysis project focuses on how to calculate and analyze standard business metrics such as daily, weekly, monthly average users (DAU/WAU/MAU), retention rates, conversion rates, lifetime value (LTV), customers acquisition cost (CAC),  and return of marketing investment (ROMI). We would like to know how effective is our advertisement strategy and how much revenue it generates. The data used were server logs of users' visits, number of orders, and marketing expenses for the given period. Finally, recommendations based on the analysis were presented as a conclusion.

## Video Game Analysis
_Keywords: SDA, EDA, hypothesis testing_

This project works on video games sales data that contains the number of sales of games from 31 different gaming platforms (PlayStation 2, 
Nintendo DS, XBox 360, PC console, etc.) in North America, Europe, Japan, and other regions. We analyzed the data to determine the best-selling games of all time, which platform is leading sales, and the most profitable genre in each region. Additionally, using hypothesis test, We also wanted to know how users' critics affect sales in different genres and platforms.
